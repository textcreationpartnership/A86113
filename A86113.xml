         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </note> which is ſtrongly preſſed, That li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Religion among infidells might with leſſe perill be permitted, becauſe their religions were erroneous, <hi>&amp; ſaepe errores plures ſe compatiuntur,</hi> and often many errors do beare one with another; but truth cannot ſtand with error; which experience convinceth of falſhood. For among the Romans the Religion of the Jewes was permitted, which then was the true Religion: and afterward there were many Chriſtians in <hi>Rome,</hi> of whom <hi>Paul</hi> was one, which then was the true Religion, who were ſo far from oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they profeſſed themſelves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that power, and made prayers and ſupplications for it. So are there among the Turks many Chriſtians who are true profeſſors of the Goſpel, and live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably without any reluctancy. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is averred, that truth cannot ſtand with error: the oppoſite is manifeſt: for among the Jewes there were divers Sects, Scribes, Phariſes, Eſſaes, and Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of which that of the Sadduces was notoriouſly erroneous, denying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection

               <p>SEeing then it is clear, that through the weakneſſe of our underſtanding in natural as well as ſpiritual things, which are onely preceptible by the light of the ſpirit, many errors and hereſies of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity muſt ariſe, and that the envious man continually ſoweth tares among the wheat, and tyrannical impoſitions on mens conſciencs have augmented and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Schiſmes of the Church, and have been the fomenters of bloody broils, to the detriment of the authors; and that Chriſt and his Apoſtles in all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114863:101"/> their teachings and practiſe abſtained from external violence, in gentleneſſe and meekneſſe inſtructing all men, we ought to refrain from all unnatural and unchriſtian force, and not to conſtraine the will of man to beleive, or ſeeme to profeſſe that which he knoweth not, but to put on the meekneſſe and gentleneſſe of Chriſt, and above all things Charity, which is the bond of Chriſtian perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to become all to all men, to ſave ſome, and to pleaſure our neighbour for his good to edification.

Then in <hi>France</hi> are the <hi>Hugonets,</hi> and the Catholiques as they diſtinguiſh them, by the prudency of their Princes reduced into a charitable and peaceable condition; who wiſely by an Edict have provided that all illiberal revilings and unworthy contumelies on either part ſhould be removed, and not any thing ſaid or acted which might tend to uncivil commotions, but that it ſhould be lawfull for every one to follow the judgment of his own minde; whereupon a bleſſed &amp; placid calm enſued: And as one, <hi>Coaleſcunt mutuâ concordiâ mentes omnium,</hi> The mindes of all by mutual concord grow together:<note place="margin">Perpinian.</note> And ſo rare is their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy and temperate behaviour, that notwithſtanding the provoking comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morations of the late inteſtine wars, they have mutual commerce,<note place="margin">Moderator. f. <hi>27.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Helveteans</hi> likewiſe, though of different judgment in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet are they united by concord and charity:<note place="margin">Daniel He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remita de rep.

And whenſoever wars and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres have been made for the cauſe of Religion, enquire from whence they have proceeded? whether from the Roman, or from the Reformed Churches; and we ſhall underſtand that the Romaniſts firſt provoked them, and they onely took up armes in their own defence. Which in it it ſelfe is apparent, if we call to minde the Sacred Wars, as they call them, but
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:114863:103"/> indeed accurſed, both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which were principally, as hath been before intimated, indicted by the Pope and his Confederates, or Holy Leagues, as they ſtile them. And whence dimaned that abominable and execrable maſſacre at <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein forty thouſand perſons were inhumanely butchered, which is notorious and odious to all Chriſtendome, whoſe children are often frighted with the memory of it. Neither is the horrible and lamentable ſlaughter to be ſuperſeded in ſilence, which lately was perpetrated by Papal Forces on the innocent and innoxious Proteſtants in <hi>Savoy,</hi> where they who by flight eſcaped their fury, were driven from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable habitations, and ſo eagerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, that they were compelled to hide themſelves in Caves, or wander on the Mountaines, and either periſh for want of food, or common with the Beaſts.
